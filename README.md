# Cafe Database

## Introduction

My goal for this project is to create a database that can be used by a front-end application to create a functional starter website for a local cafe.

## Data Fetch Requests

For this project I used Sinatra to create multiple Requests:

Get:Used to retrieve Data based on Item Category
Posts: One to post data to the Favorites table and another to Post data to the Reviews Table.
Delete: Used to allow clients to update their page as they see fit.
